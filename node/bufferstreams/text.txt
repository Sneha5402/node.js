Node.js is a powerful platform for building server-side applications, and one of its key features is its ability to interact with the file system. The File System (fs) module in Node.js provides an extensive API to work with files and directories, allowing developers to perform operations such as reading, writing, updating, and deleting files and directories. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the fs module, its features, and how to use it effectively in your applications.

File System (fs) Module in Node
The File System module, abbreviated as fs, is a core module in Node.js that allows you to interact with the file system in a way modeled on standard POSIX functions. It provides both synchronous and asynchronous methods for various file operations. The asynchronous methods are non-blocking, which means the file operations are executed in the background, allowing the application to continue running other tasks.

Key Features of the fs Module
File Reading and Writing: Easily read from and write to files, supporting both text and binary data.
File Manipulation: Create, delete, rename, and move files and directories.
File Statistics: Retrieve detailed information about files, such as size, creation date, and permissions.
Stream Handling: Efficiently handle large files and data streams.
